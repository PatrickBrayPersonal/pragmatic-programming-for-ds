- Relevance:
	- I think this presentation is highly relevant to what we do as DS/MLE. I think this presentation might be more targeted towards **mid-senior level data scientists**. Only because it's hard for Consultants to get onto _really_ technical projects that require this knowledge.
	- Maybe if you can create a presentation that goes to **basics with more examples of bad code to good code to help Consultants** know how to apply the changes you are talking about.
- Left Out:
	- Nope! You actually covered more things than I thought of and I learned some things as well! ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f642.png)
- Didn't Make Sense:
	- Everything made sense to me but, I already do quite a bit of this. I would maybe **add in a final example** to include the final topics you brought up.
- In your examples - **show how you debug your code to make it do what you want to do** (Metaprogramming, and onward in the presentation). I think it would have been easier to follow if you worked on one large example or at the end had one large example and fixed the issues you talk about in the presentation (such as a before and after). For example, in the c**oupling/decoupling it would have been really interesting to see an example**, especially for someone who _thinks_ they haven't seen code like what you're talking about. (Happy to elaborate more on this)
