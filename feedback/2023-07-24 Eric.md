Hey Patrick, spent a little bit of time organizing my thoughts.  

- Expansion opps
	- I think it would have been **really helpful to see the config file** used in metaprogramming segment
	- I think a live decoupling example would have been valuable to show
- Consolidation Ops
	- None - I thought everything was important to the presentation and related to the theme
- Nonsense
	- I think the **metaprogramming piece was the only part that could be confusing**, but a look at a config file example should resolve that

Overall, I think the presentation did a great job covering each topic and the **jupyter nbs were super helpful**. Happy to elaborate on any of the above feedback
