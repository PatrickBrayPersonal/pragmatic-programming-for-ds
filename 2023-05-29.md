## BLUF
- Programming principles can improve the experience of anyone working in data science, this talk shows how to use three principles from PP and apply it to data science work.


## Why Should I Care?
 ![[code_quality_graph.png.png]]
When Data Scientists ignore programming principles they are more likely to
1. make mistakes %%You need to know what your code does!%%
2. miss deadlines %%90% of your dev time will be spent doing non-DS stuff%%
3. experience stress %%Diving back to a mistake you made months ago%%
As a data scientist you might have great ideas. If you can't implement them reliably in your code, they will never make an impact!

## Technical Debt
*Slide on broken windows*
*Technical debt is contagious*


## Three Principles
DRY
- why is maintainability

Decoupling - Orthogonality
- why is maintainability, updates easier

Programming by Coincidence
- just because something *looks right* doesn't mean it is
- why is correctness, stability
